## Game Vision and Outcome
Inverse idea of the prior prototype where the player was restricted, now giving them not only full control and freedom but taking inspiration from action games with combos or combo meters for the game's mechanic.  

The player would once again balance a resource but it's about building it up and maintaining it rather than choosing where to use it. The vision was to explore a gameplay loop revolving around having an extreme variable in speed. Essentially, allowing the player to move around a 3D space incredibly quickly, which is a mechanic that is rarely seen in games. Our main example to inspire the idea is endgame movement in the 'Borderlands' franchise, but it is limited to endgame. We wanted to explore it as a core mechanic, and what options that might give the player as a unique movement experience. 

The final vision would be that the speed gained from defeating enemies would decay at a rate that would encourage the user to make a choice; gain more speed by eliminating enemies in quick succession, maintain speed by exploring a level and defeating an enemy every so often, or lose speed by burning it off by exploring the level and leaving enemies alone. 

Another core aspect of the final vision is that the movement feels satisfying to the player, and not overwhelming or uncontrollable.  


### Objective Statement  
Players will feel accomplished and efficient as they eliminate enemies to earn decaying speed boosts to navigate levels, and overcome obstacles.  


### Design Rationale  

The experience we wanted to put forth for the player was the exact opposite of our prior prototype. One that gives a full control scheme and instead pushes a player for more intensive movement. Movement in games is often a fundamental pillar of gameplay design that all other mechanics and map designs build off of. If the player can fly, you have to design the maps accordingly. We wanted to begin the design process with the notion that there would be very little movement restriction for levels because of the speed and jump abilities the player would have access to.

Allowing the player to chain kills to rack up speed or wait it out to burn it off is the core idea of allowing them total control of how they approach a given level. Enabling them to *break* the game as much as they desire but with levels built around that expectation. The player has the objective of completing a stage as fast as possible while making management of that speed resource as the core mechanic to achieving that goal. There is also a lot of potential for emergent and variable gameplay by adding additional motivators. Any given level could have a combination of the following mechanics to build on the core movement and objective:

- Puzzles requiring a certain speed to reach a 'key' destination.
- Enemies that carry valuable loot that are very fast, requiring you to build up speed to catch them.
- Areas that penalize you for being too fast, forcing the player to kill enemies methodically.
- Jump puzzles that require precise approaches.
- Upgrades and debuffs that effect the player character when they are speed enhanced, that may or may not be avoidable depending on how fast the player is moving, and how skillfull they are.

Exploring this mechanic also allows for unique map design. Because of the speed the player is allowed to move at, creating incredibly massive zones full of secrets would be possible, and the player would actually have a chance at finding them because of the sheer amount of ground the player could cover. Some examples of map design concepts that would be possible:

- A massive expansive desert with hidden monuments scattered around. The player would be able to zoom around the map and feel as though they are discovering something that would be impossible to find otherwise.
- A backrooms style purgatory zone. The speed would allow the player to explore and see just how expansive the place is, and would significantly add to the feeling of unease a space like that is intended to create.
- Mechanics that require extreme speed to overcome built into the map that would be very satisfying to beat. e.g., Train tunnel, falling ally, chase sequences.  

## Aesthetics  
While we were limited to the unity asset store once again, we were able to repurpose the 3D Game kit utilized in other classes for the prototype as it possessed many of the qualities we were looking for.  

The aesthetic would be along the lines of something that reinforces that quick and speedy movement and navigation, likely a lightning bolt focus that zips between creatures or something more ridiculous like a burning candle, with the speed measurement being a flame and the decay being the melting of wax.

The concept for the aesthetics would be predicated on the idea that the player is 'absorbing' something from the enemies as they are defeated, which is allowing the increased speed. Given the mechanic, thematically this makes the most sense, therefore we are leaning towards the electrical aesthetic. Currently, the idea for the game aesthetic would be that the player is either a superhuman individual, or some technologically advanced construct, that gets faster based on how overcharged they are. Enemies would all be storing energy in some form or another that the player instantly absorbs on defeating them, adding to the players overcharge.

The aesthetic of the game would also be cartoonish, something similar to Borderlands, Genshin or Journey. The reason being that the player moving at these kinds of speeds are going to cause potential rendering issues of assets if they are too high fidelity. Aesthetically, this game must be as simple as possible, especially considering the size of some of the potential map designes. If the game has too much detail, moving at very high speeds will be completely disorienting.


### Roles  
 
Allister Wylie took on the task of coding and pulling assets to assemble the project in unity as well as coding specific parts to suit our needs

Olwyn Roberts was on design team with Josh when it came do driving the idea to a fuller experience and conclusion. He'd also proved helpful for problem solving when it came to some coding issues.  

Elijah Francis was once again in charge of documentation and writting the GDD as well as taking on some design. 

Josh Simon was the first to put forth the idea for this rapid prototype and continued working on design throughout the duration. Also assisted with polishing the GDD.
