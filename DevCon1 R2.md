## Game Vision and Outcome
Inverse idea of the prior prototype where the player was restricted, now giving them not only full control and freedom but taking inspiration from action games with combos or combo meters for the game's mechanic.  

The player would once again balance a resource but it's about building it up and maintaining it rather than choosing where to lose it. As the speed gained from defeating enemies decays at a rate that would encourage the user to make a choice; gain more speed by eliminating enemies in quick succession, maintain speed by exploring a level and defeating an enemy every so often, or lose speed by burning it off by exploring the level and leaving enemies alone.  


### Objective Statement  
Players will feel accomplished and efficient as they eliminate enemies to earn decaying speed boosts to navigate levels.  


### Design Rationale  

The experience we wanted to put forth for the player was the exact opposite of our prior prototype. One that gives a full control scheme and instead pushes a player for more intensive movement.  

Allowing the player to chain kills to rack up speed or wait it out to burn it off is the big idea of allowing them total control as opposed to the last project. Enabling them to *break* the game as much as they desire but the levels built around it would take this into consideration, with the objective of completing a stage as fast as possible while making management of that speed resource equally as large of a part to play.  

## Aesthetics  
While we were limited to the unity asset store once again, we were able to repurpose the 3D Game kit utilized in other classes for the prototype as it possessed many of the qualities we were looking for.  

Ideally the aesthetic would be along the lines of something that reinforces that quick and speedy movement and navigation, likely a lightning bolt focus that zips between creatures or something more ridiculous like a burning candle, with the speed measurement being a flame and the decay being the melting of wax.  

 

### Roles  
 
Allister Wylie took on the task of coding and pulling assets to assemble the project in unity as well as coding specific parts to suit our needs

Olwyn Roberts was on design team with Josh when it came do driving the idea to a fuller experience and conclusion. He'd also proved helpful for problem solving when it came to some coding issues.  

Elijah Francis was once again in charge of documentation and writting the GDD as well as taking on some design 

Josh Simon was the first to put forth the idea for this rapid prototype and continued working on design throughout the duration. Also went through the effort of pulling assets to utilize for the project.
